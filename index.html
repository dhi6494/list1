            <li><b>Background</b></li>
            <p>Cricket's background traces to 16<sup>th</sup>century southeast England, evolving from games played by shepherds 
                using their staffs as bats and sheep pens as wickets.The sport grew in the 18th century with the establishment
                of county teams and formal rules, and the <mark>Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) </mark> was founded in 1787 to be the
                sport's governing body.</p>
            <li><b>Foundation</b></li>
            <p>The sport spread globally via British colonists and mariners, reaching North America in the 17th century 
                and other parts of the world by the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Key developments include the 1744 Laws of Cricket, the
                 development of the straight bat after the innovation of bowling over the wicket (after 1760), 
                and the founding of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1909 to govern the international game. </p>
            <li><b>Expansions and termination</b></li>
            <p>Cricket's history includes periods of both expansion and termination,
              such as its spread to the colonies in the 18<sup>th</sup> century and the <b>International Cricket Council (ICC)'s</b> 
               admission of new member countries in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

            <li><b>Tournament format</b></li>
             <p>Typically involve a combination of league play to determine qualifiers and knockout rounds
             (like single or double elimination) for elimination, though pure round-robin or elimination tournaments also exist.
              <i>The choice of format, such as T20, 10 overs, or a traditional 50-over style</i>, depends on the available time, 
             number of teams, and desired tournament length. </p>
             <li><b>Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries</b></li>
             <p>Cricket organization player acquisition involves two main types of entities:
             governing bodies like the ICC acquiring rights for projects, and franchise-based leagues 
             that directly sign players through methods like auctions and draft picks, often with the help of talent agencies.</p><hr>A standard cricket squad composition includes 11 players on the field with roles typically defined as batsmen, bowlers, wicket-keepers, and all-rounders. 
             The strategic mix of these player types can vary based on the game's format (Test, ODI, T20), pitch conditions<hr>Cricket organization salaries vary dramatically by role and organization; player salaries, like the BCCI Grade A+ players earning ₹7 crore annually, are often structured through central contracts, while administrative positions within organizations 
             like the BCCI or the ICC have diverse pay scales, with roles ranging from finance assistants to marketing executives
             <br>
             <br>
             <li><b>Match rules</b></li>
             <p> Basic rules include a bowler bowling to a batsman, with the goal to avoid getting "out" 
             <strong>(eg:by losing your wicket)</strong> while scoring runs.Specific rules for overs,
              player limits, and formats vary by organization and tournament.</p>
             <li><b>Prize money</b></li>
             <p>ICC World Cup 2023: Australia,as the winner, received $4 million (approximately ₹33 crore), while the runners-up,
             India, received <strong>$2 million </strong>(approximately ₹16 crore). <u>The losing semi-finalists, New Zealand and South Africa,each received $800,000</u> 
             (approximately ₹6.5 crore),while other teams that advanced past the group stages received $40,000.</p>
